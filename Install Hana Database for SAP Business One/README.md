HANA Database Installation for SAP Business One

In this project, I demonstrate the process of installing the SAP HANA database to support SAP Business One, a popular ERP solution for small and medium-sized enterprises. The SAP HANA database provides high-performance data processing, enabling real-time analytics and transactional processing for SAP Business One.

The installation was carried out on a SUSE Linux environment, ensuring high availability, security, and scalability for the database, which is crucial for SAP Business One's smooth operation.
