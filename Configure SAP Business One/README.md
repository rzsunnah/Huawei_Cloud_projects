# Configure SAP Business One

I have configured SAP Business One on top of the SAP HANA database, which provides high-performance data processing for the ERP solution. SAP Business One is an integrated ERP solution designed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The project focuses on configuring essential modules of SAP Business One, integrating the software with the SAP HANA database, and setting up the business processes necessary for a seamless ERP experience.
